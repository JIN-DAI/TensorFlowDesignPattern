# TensorFlowDesignPattern
Use decorator to structure the TensorFlow project.

The project follows the suggestion as in https://danijar.com/structuring-your-tensorflow-models/ .

At the moment, we support the vanilla RNN model. The vacobulary asset and stateful RNN will be considered later. Any suggestions are welcome.
